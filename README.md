# Road-Accident-Dashboard-
I have created this Dashboard to analyze and visualize accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. 
It highlights important metrics and trends related to road accidents, helping users understand the key factors influencing accident severity and casualties.

Key Components of the Dashboard:

Primary KPIs: Total Casualties: Calculated using a pivot table to provide a comprehensive overview of all casualties resulting from accidents.

Accident Severity and Casualty Distribution: Visualized through pie charts, showing the percentage of casualties in relation to accident severity and the maximum casualties based on the type of vehicle involved.

Secondary KPIs: Casualties by Vehicle Type: Displays the total number of casualties for each type of vehicle.

Monthly Trend Analysis: A comparative analysis of casualties between the current year (2022) and the previous year (2021), allowing users to observe monthly trends and fluctuations.

Maximum Casualties by Road Type: This shows which road types experience the highest number of casualties.

Casualty Distribution by Road Surface: Analyzes the impact of road surface conditions on casualty numbers.

Casualties by Area/Location and Day/Night: Examines the relationship between the number of casualties based on the area or location of the accident and the time of occurrence (day or night).
